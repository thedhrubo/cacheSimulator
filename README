To install, do the following 

1. 'cd' to the directory containing the files and folders. 
2. Run 'make' in the terminal.
3. This creates the executable file in the bin/ folder


To run the program, 
	
	$ ./bin/cache_simulator <configuration_file> <trace_file> 
	
Configuration files are kept in conf folder
trace files are kept in trace folder

example command to run the program :

$bin/cache_simulator conf/small-dm.conf trace/twolf.trace

after executing this command an output file will generate with twolf.trace.out . To check the output we can execute :

vim trace/twolf.trace.out

A barchart naming barchart.xlsx is also included with the project with providing the all test results.

CONFIGURATION FILE DETAILS 
**********************************************************************

In the configuration file, the necessary parameters need to be defined. 
	Line size : Any positive integer
        Associativity : Any positive integer
        Data Size : Specifies the total size of the data in the cache. This does not include the size
                    of any overhead (such as tag size). It should be specified in KB and be a non-negative
                    power of 2. For example, a value of "64" means a 64KB cache.
        Replacement Policy
		0 (for random replacement)
		1 (for FIFO)
        Cache miss penalty
        WritePolicy 
		0 (for no-write-allocate)
		1 (for write-allocate)	
	
	
	Cache hit time is treated default 1.

There needs some updates like dirty bit is not implemented. I didn't get that much time for that.
